'''
Like what we did in Caesar Cipher, but also shift the whole string left by r

Examples:

input:
s = "defghi", k = 3, r = 3
1. shift each character left alphabetically by k: "defghi" -> "abcdef"
2. shift the whole string by r: "abcdef" -> "defabc"

output:
"defabc"

input:
s = "abc", k = 2, r = 5

output:
"ayz"
